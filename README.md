# project-2

## project-2 / Fonds voor West - Ironhack
This is a module 2 project for the Web Development course by Ironhack, started in september 2020. 

## Motivation
The project was created by students Ashley Vermaas and Dirk Kelderman. The project tried to solve a problem the grant funding platform "Fonds voor West" was having. The issue at hand was the use of their current platform. It wasn't really user friendly, and also they had a lot of problems with getting the right data and right information for their committee members.

## Build status
As always, the project is never finished. However we're pretty confident this is a MVP with a nice view for the future.
